# Waterwell

Objective: This program calculates the number of gallons that is stored in the well casing.

    Print out the outocme of the program to the user.
         
    Declare the value of PI as CONSTANT to use later.
       
    Ask the user what the radius of the well casing is (in inches).

    Store what the user entered into a float varaible named radius.

    Ask the user what the depth of the well is (in feet).

    Store what the user entered into a float variable named depth.
        
    It is time to run some Math

        Convert the radius into feet.

        Calculate the cubic feet of the well using the variables given by the user.

        Convert cubic feet into gallons by mutiplying it by 7.48
        since (1 cubic foot = 7.48 gallons of water).
     
    Print out the final answer.

    Tell user that the program ran successfully and instructs them to run the program
    again if they are interested.

The End
